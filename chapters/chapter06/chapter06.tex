In the previous chapters, we have explored all kind of weighted games, where the weight functions were bounded. In this chapter, we will explore a new kind of a game. Here also, we have strong bounds on weights, but player $1$ can violate one of the bounds, w.l.o.g, say the upper bound. The number of vertices, he traverses along his path with weights higher than the upper bound are called \textbf{violations}. In this game, we have a bound on the number of violations. We call this bounded violations reachability game as \textit{Apna Game}. We formally define it in the following section.\\

\section{Description of the Game}
Consider a game graph $G=\langle Q_1, Q_2, E, w, q_0, T \rangle$, a lower bound $l$, an upper bound $U$ and a

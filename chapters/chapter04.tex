In this chapter, we will consider the quantitative games, where player $1$ has to reach his goal, always maintaining his weights inside two bounds. This chapter we will consider both the bounds to be strong.

\section{Finite Total Payoff Reachability}

In this section, we will use total payoff as our quantitative function. Given a game graph $G=\langle Q_1, Q_2, E, w, q_0, T \rangle$, an upper bound $U \in \mathbb{N}$ and a lower bound $b \in \mathbb{N}$, finite total payoff reachability objective with dual bound says that, with zero initial energy starting from $q_0$, player $1$ has to reach $T$ in a path $\rho$ such that, for all finite prefixes $\rho^{\prime}$ of $\rho$, $l\leq TP(\rho^{\prime})\leq U$, where $TP$ is simply the sum of the weight of the edges as defined earlier.
